## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

AnonymousAds is a web application that serves targeted advertising to users, without compromising user privacy.

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->

## Methodology

### Pre-Requisites

The dev container contains all files and code required to generate pre-requisites. 






<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

AnonymousAds is built to run on desktops.

To get a local copy of AnonymousAds up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Docker desktop is required to run the application.

Download Docker at [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

We recommend having at least 6GB of Disk Space and 2GB of RAM.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Apzure/AnonymousAds.git
   ```
2. Open Docker desktop
3. Enter in the terminal

   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
4. Open up the link [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) provided in the terminal

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. When the opening the link above, you will be greeted by this landing page. Enter your queries into the search bar and hit ENTER or click the search button on the right

<!-- INSERT SCREENSHOT OF LANDING PAGE HERE -->

2. Initially, there would be no ads displayed on the page. 

<!-- INSERT SCREENSHOT OF QUERY PAGE HERE + NO ADS-->

3. Every 5 queries, the page would be automatically updated with new ads based on your search results. It would take 5-10 seconds for the ads to be updated.

<!-- INSERT SCREENSHOT OF QUERY PAGE HERE + ADS-->

4. You can view your past queries by clicking on the HISTORY icon 

<!-- INSERT SCREENSHOT OF QUERY PAGE HERE + ADS + HISTORY-->

5. You view the logs on Docker Desktop for more information.

### Training the model

As described in the methodology above, the `server.zip` and `client.zip` files are used to generate the public keys and stores the model for the server. If you would like to train the model yourself and generate these files, you can follow these steps:

1. Enable the `dev` container by setting `ENABLE_DEV_SERVICE=1` in the `.env` file in the root of the repo
2. Open Docker desktop
3. Enter in the terminal

   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
4. The `dev` container should be running on Docker Desktop, you can view the logs and track the progress of the model
5. Once the `dev` container has exited, access the files generated by the container under `dev/fhe_directory/`. You can save them in your local machine. You may delete the other two containers after this.
6. Replace the respective zip files in `search-engine/fhe` and `server/fhe`. 
7. Run `docker compose up` again, and the model is now the newly trained model!

# Anonymous Ads

1. Generates User Data (collect and compile search engine results, tiktok)
2. Encryption
3. Send to external Server [do we have to implement this?]
4. Apply transformations to process it into encrypted Tags, Categories, Keywords that help determine what ads to show a specific user
5. Send back to the user
6. Decryption
7. Add dummy tags and request the set of ads from TikTok
8. Display selected ads, with the real tags to the user

9. - On start-up Concrete ML model is trained on clear data on server side
   - Client generates public keys and sends to server
10. Search-Engine FrontEnd
    - Your Search History, sends after every 10 Requests / Button
11. ## Encryption and send to server
12. Apply Transformations on the server-side
13. Send back transformed data along with set of all tags to user
14. Decryption
15. User randomly selects dummy tags from the set of all tags
16. User requests ads from the server that include these tags

    - Concrete ML model is trained and compiled on clear data on dev side using the FHEModelDev class

    - Client generates public keys and sends to server
    - Client inputs search queries and this is saved
    - Search History is converted to "input" is sent to server
    - Server takes input and uses model to predict tags (output is encrypted)
    - Server sends encrypted prediction to Client and set of all tags
    - Client decrypts prediction, and adds noise to the prediction
    - Server gets ads
